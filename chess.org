** game
*** numbers (a+b)
    a (in minutes) is the time you have for thinking and playing your moves in the whole game
    b (in seconds) is the number of time that is added everytime you play a move
    total time for game = a+b*(number of moves)
*** types
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_chess
    https://lichess.org/faq#time-controls
    bullet      one or two minutes per side
    blitz       less than 10 minutes per side (often 5 minutes)

   | piece  | value |
   |--------+-------|
   | Queen  |   9   |
   | Rook   |   5   |
   | Bishop |   3   |
   | Knight |   3   |
   | Pawn   |   1   |

   Two bishops coordinate very well as the bishop pair because they can operate on all the squares on the board In
   an open position (one with few blocked pawns) the bishop pair is stronger thana bishop and a knight. So the
   bishop is worth a tad more than the knight. In a closed position in which the bishops are restricted by blocked
   pawn chains the knight, on the other hand, is more mobile.

** pawn chains
   attack a pawn chain at its base!
   black d5, e6, f7 is a pawn chain, d5 is its base
   white d4, e5 is a pawn chain, d4 is its base; b2, c3, d4, e5 is a strong white pawn chain
